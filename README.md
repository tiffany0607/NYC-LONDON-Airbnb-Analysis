## Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb market patterns in New York City (NYC) and London using publicly available listings and reviews data. The goal is to understand how supply, demand, host behavior, pricing, and neighbourhood characteristics differ between the two cities—and what these differences reveal about market maturity and hosting opportunities.

In short, we will:

* Identify factors that influence booking prices Compare demand/price in different cities during certain holidays (eg. Christmas, New Years, etc.)
* Understand factors that contribute to booking demands of certain locations during certain periods.
* Understand key factors that influence customer reviews (eg. what contributed to bad/good reviews?)

### Data Overview
All datasets used in this project are taken from this website, where it includes Airbnb information (listings, reviews, locations, etc) of various major cities around the world.
