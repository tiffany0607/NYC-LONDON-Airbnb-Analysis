A Comparative Analysis of Pricing, Demand, and Market Dynamics Using SQL, BigQuery, and Tableau


## Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb market patterns in New York City (NYC) and London using publicly available listings and reviews data. The goal is to understand how supply, demand, host behavior, pricing, and neighbourhood characteristics differ between the two cities—and what these differences reveal about market maturity and hosting opportunities.
